PURPOSE: To provide a lens (an intraocular implant) which exhibits high flexibility and is easily insertable to the proper point in the film of a crystalline lens by providing the lens with a central part and elastic supporting part of the shape of a circular crown constituting the lens and integrally forming this supporting part and the central part. CONSTITUTION: An implantation tissue body 20 consists of the central part 21 of the circular shape constituting the lens itself and the elastic supplying part 22. This supporting part is coupled to the central part 21 only by the single material part 24. As a result, the impartation of flexibility to the implantation tissue body and the 'folding' of this body to the max. possible extent during the introducing into the eye are made possible.; Then, the incision ought to be executed to the cornea and film in order to insert the implantation tissue body to the proper point may be minimized. Further, a blind hole 25 is installed at the central part of the mounting part 24 and this hole is adapted to receive the end of a hook-shaped appliance, by which the correct positioning of the transplantation tissue body into the eye by a surgeon is made possible.
