PURPOSE:To make it possible to positive-negative symmetric coil current only by a unipolar electric power source by switching alternate terminals at both sides of a series circuit of a driving coil and capacitor from a positive potential to zero. CONSTITUTION:With switches S5 and S4 closed, capacitor C is charged and capacitor voltage Vc and coil voltage Vs1 of the switch S1 side increase from zero to +Vo. After initial charging, switches S5 and S4 are opened while switches S2 and S3 are closed. As a result, voltage Vs2 at the coupling point between switches S3 and S4 changes to +V1 and voltage Vs1 drops to OV; and voltage Vc increases to +(V0+V1) and Vc loses V1 due to a revolution loss to reach -V0 a half period later. For the purpose, switches S2 and S3 are opened and S1 and S4 are closed a half period later to set voltage Vs2 to OV and Vs1 to +V1 and consequently, voltage Vc changes to -(Vo+V1) and then approximates to +Vo a half cycle later. As a result, voltage Vc-Vs1 applied to driving coil L has the same waveform with voltage Vc at any time, so that it will be symmetrical between the positive and negative.
