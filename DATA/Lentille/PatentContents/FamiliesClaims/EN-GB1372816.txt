WHAT WE CLAIM IS: -
1 A method of working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens, comprising gripping a flexible contact lens blank between 115 a pair of coaxial rotary spindles, rotating the spindles, and bringing into contact with the lens blank a flat abrasive working surface disposed obliquely with respect to the axes of the spindles and normal to the peripheral 120 edge of the lens blank, the arrangement being such that the peripheral portion of the lens blank is so deformed by contact with the working surface that it periodically reverses itself under deformation by pressure of the 125 surface so that the opposed faces of the peripheral zone of the sides of the lens blank are alternately abraded to provide the lens with 1,372,816 an edge having a satisfactory wearer tolerance level.
2 A method according to claim 1 wherein the steps are repeated with another working surface comprising an abrasive material finer than that of the first working surface.
3 An apparatus for working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens blank, comprising a pair of coaxial rotary spindles axially movable relative to each other for gripping and rotating a flexible contact lens blank therebetween, and a flat working surface disposed obliquely with respect to the axis of the spindles and mounted for movement relative to the rotary spindles in a direction normal to the working surface.
4 A method of working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens substantially as described herein and illustrated in accompanying drawings.
An apparatus for working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens substantially as described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
