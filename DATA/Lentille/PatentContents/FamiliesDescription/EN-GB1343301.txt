cribed in and by the following statement:-
The present invention relates generally to the machining of contact lenses of flexible material.
Lenses of this kind are well known per se.
They can be obtained by pouring a suitable synthetic material, silicone for example, into moulds, and preferably are subsequently treated to render them water-absorbent, for example by radio-chemical grafting of Nvinyl-pyrrolidone.
After moulding and before this grafting treatment, these lenses must be reduced to correct diameter and machined The reduction to diameter consists of the eliminattion of the excess peripheral portion of a rough lens, in order to bring the latter to a diameter suitable for its use, and the machining consists of an appropriate thinning of the edges of a lens of this kind reduced to correct diameter.
However, the flexibility of the lens due to the nature of its constituent material and also to its small thickness renders the correct execution of these diameter reducing and machining operations difficult.
In fact, when this machining is carried out in a conventional manner on a machine comprising two rotating spindles, between which the lens to be machined is gripped, it is necessary to centre this lens on the spindles, and this centering, carried out by hand up to the present day is rendered difficult and delicate due to the flexibility and small thickness of such a lens.
In addition, during its machining, the lens is the centre of deformation due to centrifugal force, this deformation resulting most frequently in a flattening of its curvature and in consequence in a variation in diameter.
The main object of the present invention is to provide a method and a device which enable these difficulties to be minimised, and in consequence permitting the machining of flexible contact lenses just as easily and also as effectively as in the case of rigid contact lenses.
According to the present invention a method of machining the peripheral edge of a contact lens of flexible plastics material, comprises placing the lens between two rotating spindles, of which one at least is a driving spindle, centering the lens with respect to the spindles, bringing the spindles close to each other to grip the lens supporting one of the faces of the lens by an annular supporting member setting at least the driving spindle in rotation, spraying the lens and the extremities of the spindles and of the supporting member by a jet of freezing fluid to harden the lens, withdrawing supporting member and machining the lens If required the lens diameter may be reduced to a predetermined value prior to machining it.
In one embodiment the centering of the lens on the rotating spindles is effected mechanically by a sleeve mounted slidably on one of the spindles Preferably, but not necessarily, with a view to facilitating its subsequent centering, the lens is provided during its moulding with a peripheral reinforcing shoulder which advantageously improves its rigidity.
Alternatively the centering of the lens on the rotating spindle is carried out optically by means of a focal distance meter placed along the axis of the spindles This avoids a possible de-centering with respect to each of the moulds used for moulding the lens which might give the said lens an undesirable prismatic eect.
According to another alternative embodiment, the diameter of the lens is previously reduced to size by punching it out on a focal distance meter, the focal distance meter having permitted the centering of the lens with respect to its optical centre, prior to the reduction in lens diameter.
The lens may be hardened by spraying a freezing fluid, such as liquid nitrogen or air, which gives the lens sufficient rigidity for it to be suitably machined.
0 PM , 1,343,301 This rigidity is then effective when the lens is advantageously supported by a supporting member, preferably chosen so as to have a contact with the lens, a supporting surface having a radius comparable with that of the corresponding face of the lens.
This arrangement makes it possible for the lens to retain permanently its dimensional characteristics, and prevents any subsequent deformation The machining may thus be effected under advantageous conditions.
In particular, the lens is not liable to be deformed between the reduction of the diameter and the machining, since its rigidity is maintained due to continuously spraying it with a freezing fluid In addition, its initial centering remains unchanged, the operations of reducing the diameter and machining being advantageously carried out continuously on the same device.
From another aspect of the invention a device for machining a contact lens of flexible material, comprising two coaxial rotatable spindles, at least one of which is a driving spindle, and one of which is moveable axially with respect to the other, a centering sleeve slidably mounted on one spindle, an annular supporting member slidably mounted on the other spindle, at least one nozzle for applying a spray for freezing the lens, and a toolcarrier slide Preferably a diameter-reduction tool carrier slide is also provided.
The setting in rotation of the driving spindle is preferably carried out in two stages In a first stage, this rotating spindle is started-up at reduced speed, less than 1,000 r.p m, for example, until the lens and parts in contact therewith have been completely cooled by the jet of freezing fluid, this being done so as to prevent centrifugal force from deforming the lens while it is still flexible.
Then, a second stage, the rotating spindle is brough up to full speed, namely to a speed higher than 15,000 r p m for example, suitable to enable reducing to diameter and machining of the lens to be carried out.
In order that the invention may be more fully understood embodiments in accordance therewith will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Fig 1 is a view in diagrammatic perspective of a machining device; Fig 2 is a view in partial avial section of the rotating spindles of the device of Fig 1:
Figs 3 A to 3 D show on a different scale, a part of Fig 2 and each illustrates respectively a machining phase of a lens of flexible material; and Fig 4 is a diagrammatic view in axial section of a device for reducing to diameter capable of being associated with the machining device of Fig 1.
A lens of flexible material is indicated in these drawings by the general reference 10.
This lens is obtained in known manner by pouring a suitable synthetic material, silicone for example, between two rigid halfmoulds.
By way of example, the following overall dimensions may be indicated:
Peripheral diameter Internal radius External radius Thickness 14 mm.
7 6 mm.
8 3 mm.
O 2 mm.
As will be readily understood, due to its small thickness and to the actual nature of its constituent material, a lens of this kind is only an extremely flexible skin and does not in any case have sufficient stiffness to be immedialy machined.
Preferably, but not necessarily, the lens 10 is provided by moulding with a peripheral 85 shoulder 11 which improves its rigidity.
Fig 1 shows diagrammatically a machining device, in which the constituent elements, taken individually, are well known in themselves They will not therefore be des 90 cribed in detail below It is only necessary to specify that such a device comprises a spindle 12 rotatably mounted in a frame block 13 and driven in rotation by a motor 14 through the intermediary of a transmis 95 sion 15 of any kind, a spindle 17 rotatably mounted in a frame block 18 and movable axially therein, an operating crank handle 19, a diameter reducing tool-carrier 20 moveably mounted perpendicularly to the spindles 100 12, 17 and parallel thereto, as indicated diagrammatically by the arrows 21, 21 ' and 22, 221 respectively, and an edge machining tool with a carriage 24 is moveably mounted perpendicularly to the spindles 12, 17 and 105 parallel thereto as indicated diagrammatically by the arrows 25, 251 and 26, 261 respectively.
The machining tool-carrier slide 24 may also be pivotally mounted (as will be des 110 cribed with reference to Fig 3 c) about an axis perpendicular to the rotating spindles 12, 17 and passing substantially through the working zone 27 thereof, as shown diagrammatically by the arrow 28 A similar 115 arrangement can be adopted for the diameter-reducing tool-carrier slide 20, for reasons which will become apparent later.
The device in addition comprises a nozzle mounted directly above the working zone 120 27 of the rotating spindles 12, 17 for spraying the latter with a freezing fluid.
To this end, this nozzle 30 is coupled to a tank 31 containing such a freezing fluid and arranged above the spindles 12, 17 for 125 gravity feed of the freezing fluid.
This fluid is chosen so as to have a temperature below 100  C, for example, liquid air or liquid or gaseous nitrogen, the liquefaction temperature of which is known to be -173 C.
Experience has shown that this temperature is sufficient to give the lens 10 a rigidity sufficient to permit its machining, whereas the use of solid carbon dioxide is ineffective in this respect As cold temperatures render the materials more fragile, the flow-rate must be a function of the fluid chosen and of the constituent material of the lens, in order to avoid excessive fragility of this latter.
As can be seen in Fig 2, a sleeve 35 is slidably mounted on the rotating spindle 12, and this sleeve is provided at its extremity with an annular housing 36, the diameter of which is substantially equal to that of the lens 10 to be machined.
Similarly, a sleeve 37 is slidably mounted on the rotating spindle 17, it being possible to fix this sleeve for rotation with this spindle as by a cone-pointed grub screw 38 with a knurled head 39 as shown or by other known means such as interengaging bands and grooves on the spindle and sleeve This sleeve 37 carries an annular supporting member 40 engaged on one extremity 41 of smaller diameter, of the rotating spindle 17.
The annular supporting member 40 consists of a rigid collar 42, of metal for example, having an annular groove 43 in which studs 44 carried by the sleeve 37 are engaged, and a lens supporting part 45 rigidly fixed in an appropriate manner on the collar 42 The annular supporting member 40 is thus free for rotation with respect to the sleeve 37 on which it is carried.
The transverse outer face 48 of the lens supporting part 45 preferably has a radius substantially equal to the internal radius of the lens 10 to be machined To this end, the lens supporting part is advantageously produced by moulding any kind of material in a mould having the same curvature as the lens 10, and this material, synthetic material for example, is preferably chosen to be relatively soft, for reasons which will become apparent later.
The machining of the lens 10 is then effected in the following manner; The lens is placed between the rotating spindles 12, 17 and is then capped by the sleeve 35 which ensures its centering on the rotating spindles; the lens supporting part 45 is then brought into contact with the lens 10 contiguous with the transverse outer face of the extremity 41 of smaller diameter of the spindle 17, and clamping of the spindles 12, 17 together is effected by the crank-arm 19 so as to hold the lens 10 in its centered position (see Fig 3 A).
Once the lens is centered, the sleeve 35 is withdrawn and the rotating spindle 12 is started up at a reduced speed, less than 1,000 r.p m for example The combination of the lens 10, the extremities of the spindles 12, 17 and the part 45 are sprayed with the freezing fluid contained in the tank 31 until the lens 10 is completely hardened; the rotating spindle 12 is then run-up to full speed, at a speed higher than 15,000 r p m for example 70 (see Fig 3 83); the shape of the annular supporting member 40 ensures that the rigid configuration of the lens 10 effected during its freezing is identical with its initial configuration 75 The diameter-reducing tool-carrier slide is brought up to the working zone 27 of the rotating spindles 12, 17 and by displacement of this slide, and therefore the diameter reducing tool 50 which it car 80 ries, in a direction parallel to the spindles 12, 17, the machining of the lens 10 to correct diameter is effected as shown in Fig.
3 C so that the edge of the lens is cut parallel to the axis of the lens In an 85 alternative arrangement, if before operation of the tool on the lens the slide 20 can be pivoted about an axis perpendicular to the spindles 12, 17, as suggested above, to a position where the edge of the lens is cut 90 perpendicular to the faces of the lens instead of perpendicular to the axis thereof, the reduction to diameter is effected perpendicularly to the faces of the lens 10, which is preferable for a uniform removal 95 of material during subsequent machining.
Irrespective of this, the preferably soft nature of the supporting part 45 prevents any damage to the diameter reducing too, and this supporting part ensures the correct 100 holding of the lens during machining.
The sleeve 37 is then caused to slide on the rotating spindle 17, without stopping the rotation of the spindle until the supporting piece 45 is completely withdrawn, and by 105 displacement of the machining tool-carrier slide 24 the machining tool 51 carried thereby is brought into contact with the reduced edge 52 of the lens 10, for machining this edge, as shown in Fig 3 D 110 The machining operation is made possible, as explained above, by the hardening of this lens by freezing, the spray of freezing fluid being maintained during the whole period of the diameter-reducing and machin 115 ing operations.
Fig 4 relates to an additional device in which the diameter-reduction of the lens is carried out before it is passed into the machining device described above 120 This operation of reducing the diameter of the lens to size is effected by punching it out on a focal distance meter, the focal distance meter having permitted the centering of the lens with respect to the optical 125 centre This focal distance meter 60 comprises an eve-piece 61, a lens 62 and an object carrier 63 which comprises a supporting ring 64 and a rubber damping ring 65.
On the frame 66 of the eye-piece, or on 130 1,343,301 1,343,301 a portion fixed to this frame, a punching out device 70 is pivotally mounted The punching out device is also mounted for movement against the force of a spring 71 This punching out device is supported on an elbowed rod 72 which passes through an opening 73 in the frame 66 Thus it is moveable between a working position shown in full lines, for which it is along the axis of the focal distance meter, and a rest position shown in doted lines in which it is remote from the axis.
In the solid line or working position of the device 70 in Fig 4, an axial movement of the punching out device can reduce the diameter of the lens 10 by punching out, the lens having previously been centered optically on the focal distance meter.
The machining of the lens 10 is then carried out as previously described with reference to Figs 1 to 3 D, this lens being centered mechanically on this device by the sleeve 35.
It will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above but covers any alternative form of construction within the scope of
