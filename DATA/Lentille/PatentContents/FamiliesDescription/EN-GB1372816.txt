International Classification B 24 B 9/14 Index at acceptance B 3 D 1 H 3 1 H 9 B ( 54) METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR WORKING FLEXIBLE CONTACT LENSES ( 71) We, ESSILOR INTERNATIONAL "Cie Generale d'Optique", a French body corporate of 7 rue de la Libert 6, 94 Joinvillele Pont, France, do hereby declare the invention for which we pray that a patent may be granted to us, and the method by which it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and by the following statement:-
The present invention concerns any one of the working operations such as machining, softening, polishing or grinding, carried out at the periphery of a flexible contact lens.
Flexible contact lenses are usually made by moulding Flexible lenses are most often moulded to a diameter greater than the final lens diameter and then a peripheral portion is removed for reducing the diameter to the desired dimension, and finally a machining of the peripheral edge of the lens which is necessary to obtain a suitable profile.
The machining operation is particularly important since the possibility of prolonged use by its wearer depends at least in part on the results thereof.
Now, since we are concerned with flexible contact lenses, namely contact lenses of silicone 3 such machining is relatively difficult to carry out; indeed, the flexible nature of the lense in itself creates an obstacle to machining.
Various systems have been proposed to overcome this difficulty Essentially they attempt to effect temporary rigidity by spinning or freezing to enable machining.
These systems have not shown themselves adapted to low cost mass production of contact lenses Accordingly, flexible contact lenses have not as yet been made commercially available.
The aim of the present invention is a method and apparatus which takes advantage of the very flexibility of flexible contact lenses and thereby facilitates the machining of the peripheral edge of the lens.
According to the present invention a method of working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens, comprises gripping a 1 1 flexible contact lens blank between a pair of coaxial rotary spindles, rotating the spindles, and bringing into contact with the lens blank a flat abrasive working surface disposed obliquely with respect to the axes of the spindles and normal to the peripheral edge of the lens blank, the arrangement being such that the peripheral portion of the lens blank is so deformed by contact with the working surface that it periodically reverses itself under deformation by pressure of the surface so that the opposed faces of the peripheral zone of the sides of the lens blank are alternatively abraded to provide the lens with an edge having a satisfactory wearer tolerance level.
The invention further comprises an apparatus for working the peripheral portion of a flexible contact lens blank, comprising a pair of coaxial rotary spindles axially movable relative to each other for gripping and rotating a flexible contact lens blank therebetween and a flat working surface disposed obliquely with respect to the axis of the spindles and mounted for lateral movement relative to the rotary spindles in a direction normal to the working surface.
It has been found that the resilient deformation of the contact lens being worked which is at the very heart of the present invention periodically reverses itself so that the two faces of the peripheral portion of the contact lens are alternatively and successively in contact with the working surface.
In the course of a first pass the working surface is of a first sutable abrasive material enabling the rough grinding of the peripheral portion of the lens.
In the course of subsequent passes, the working surface is of finer and finer grained material enabling user to arrive at a very satisfactory satin ground finish.
Experience shows that the lenses worked in this way have a satisfactory wearer tolerance level.
Further advantages and features of the present invention will be brought out in the description which follows by way of example
1) 1372816 1,372,816 with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings in which:
Figure 1 is a partly cut-away elevation view of the present device during a first step of the present method; Figure 2 shows a plan view of the device of Figure 1; Figures 3 and 4 are partial views similar to Figures 1 and 2 respectively illustrate a second step of the method according to the invention; Figure 5 shows a diagram illustrating the operation of the device; and Figure 6 is an enlarged partial view of the periphery of the lens.
In Figure 1 a flexible contact lens blank is shown gripped between two coaxial rotary spindles 11, 12 in a manner known per se At least one of the spindles 11 and 12 is driven in rotation by suitable drive means (not shown) The contact lens blank is geometrically centered along the axis of rotation of the rotary spindles 11, 12.
The blank is obtained by moulding to a diameter greater than the final lens diameter then removing a peripheral portion; the edge 13 of the periphery 14 is therefore rather pointed or angular.
What is involved is the grinding down of the periphery 14 by removing material from both faces of the periphery portion forming a finger-shaped tapered cross sectional configuration.
Accordingly, the apparatus comprises a support 15 carrying a planar working surface 16, the support 15 being movable relative to the rotary spindles 11 in a direction D oblique with respect to the axis of the rotary spindles.
The working surface is oriented in such a way as to come into contact with the peripheral edge 13 of the lens blank perpendicular to the periphey In other words, the normal N of the working surface 16 in contact with the peripheral edge 13 of the lens is situated along the median plane of the periphery.
The working surface 16 may be formed of any working material.
For the first work pass which is more precisely a machining or reducing pass, the material is, for example, an abrasive of the type used for working flexible synthetic materials By way of example, the material sold by Norton under the Trade Mark Durite E 800 is satisfactory.
By displacement of the support 15 which carries the working surface 16, the latter is brought into contact with the peripheral edge 13 of the lens blank to be machined perpendicular to, the edge (Figure 1) after the rotary spindles 11, 12 are moved into gripping position with the lens blank therebetween.
The advance of the support 15 perpendicular to, the periphery 14 of the lens blank is continued until the force exerted thereon causes a deformation, more particularly a resilient deformation, of the periphery (Figure 3).
This deformation may reach for example 0.2 to, 0 3 mm for a lens blank having a dia 70 meter of approximately 9 mm Experience shows that as the spindles 11, 12 rotate, the resilient deformation reverses itself alternately and successively to both sides of the normal or rest position of the lens blank In other 75 words this deformation is alternately below the normal or rest position of the lens blank such as shown in solid lines in Figure 3 and above this normal or rest position such as illustrated in broken lines in Figure 3 80 When the lens is deformed to move below the rest or normal position of the lens, the top face A of the lens blank is is contact with, the working surface 16 thereby machining this face Alternatively, when the lens blank 85 is deformed to move above the normal or rest position of the lens blank, the bottom face B of the lens blank is in contact with the working surface 16 machining this face in turn 90 This alternate machining of the faces A and B of the lens is symbolized in the graphic showing in Figure 5 wherein time is represented along the X-axis and the side machined along the Y-axis 95 Figure 6 illustrates the results obtained translated into, the desired forming of the periphery 14 of the lens blank by removing material from the upper face A of the periphery during certain periods and from the 100 lower face B during other periods In Figure 6 the final configuration of the periphery is shown in solid lines, and the original peripheral configuration is shown in broken lines.
Other passes may follow the above-des 105 cribed machining pass, for example, the grinding or polishing of the periphery of zthe lens.
Such a polishing step is effected by using a suitable working surface 16 comprising for example pitch with which a suitable amount 110 of pulverulent abrasive material is combined.
