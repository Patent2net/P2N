================
- Release Patent2Net 2.0.0

2014-10-30 1.0.0
================
- Future development will add scenaris of analysis (one scenary, one network e.G authors, applicants etc. to avoid the need of Gephi expert's skills)
- revisiting weight nodes on networks
- check abstracts gathering (seems lack of content)
- complete content gathering
- clean unused function and code everywhere ^_^

2014-03-04 0.9.0
================
- OpsGather-PatentList

    - Accept an Espacenet "smart search" query

- PatentsToNet

    - Fully connected graph is provided in Gephi, connecting any relation (intra and Inter field) : filtering can be done in Gephi or hacking in the Python script.
    - International Patent Classification is treated to be "truncated" at level 1,3,4,7. nodes for each level are created
    - Countries from Patent numbers (first deposit?) are considered as nodes
    - Kind codes (status) are separated as nodes
    - URL links as node attribute in gexf

        - for patent number : link to espacenet
        - for International Patent Classification IPC at level 1,3,4 : link to IPC database (French and English)

    - Dynamic graph are available over first available date (column "deb" and "fin" as to be merged as timeline for nodes and edges in data laboratoty in Gephi)
    - Directed graph is build complete in bidirection mode: Inventor-Inventor; IPC-IPC; Applicant-Applicant, and all combinations
